# Adding Modules to your Nuxt Project

Modules are a way to extend Nuxt with additional functionality. They can be used to add
new components, plugins, or even custom routes.

For the common dependencies like for example Tailwind or PrimeVue, there is an easy way
to add them to your Nuxt project.

::: warning
Make sure to follow the correct folder structure, otherwise your modules won't work!
